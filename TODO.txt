TODO:

!!!!update diss log

add puzzle building blocks - will take form of WHEN(event) blocks
    --- test currently added protoypes.

NOTE: alright, so custom markers work now, but they must be referenced as
live url's, not as relative files stored on the server.

add stuff other than 3d models to marker - image (flat, vertical, facing camera??), video(sames), text(same actually damn)

now need to create library of custom markers and pattern files,
host them on github, then create a choose/print system within quando.

alter showGLTF methods to allow for multiple makers? - change camera element

add lerp smoothing??

figure out how to not allow marker dependant puzzle blocks without having a marker??

add loading icon?

SESSIONS! users need to be able to use the same deployed file independantly of each other



GEN NOTES:
ask andy if save load icons should be switched
npm install --unsafe-perm --global leveldown

flag issue on ar.js about a-marker vs a-marker-camera
